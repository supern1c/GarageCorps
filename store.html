                <p>The CB77, or Superhawk, is sportbike genesis for Honda. The 305cc parallel twin powering the CB77 could freely rev to nine grand and easily send riders over the ton (100 MPH) set by the British big twins. It was the Honda’s reliability, however, that established and cemented the Japanese manufacturer’s reputation in the Western world.</p>

Delivering incredible bang for the buck, the CB750 could smoothly and comfortably top 120 MPH thanks to its race proven inline-four layout.</p>

In fact, when Honda revealed their iconic CB in 1968, Kawasaki scrapped their almost ready for prime-time 750cc effort and declared a power war on the superbike world. When it finally hit the showroom floor in 1973. </p>

Within a decade, a version of this engine could be found in every competitor’s model.

Originally designed for sidecar duty, the combination of a punchy flat twin and an Earle’s fork design made it an incredibly capable bike both on- and off-road. So formidable was the R60 that rider Danny Liska took his beautiful black beast for a 95,000 mile ride.</p>

Harley Davidson has smartly done very little with the Sportster recipe.

Taking what Triumph had started with the Speed Twin, Norton employed a former Rolls-Royce engineer to develop a package for the larger 750cc Norton parallel-twin. The revolutionary use of rubber mounting for the mechanicals meant that the vibrations inherent with high strung twins at speed was all but eliminated.</p>

The V-Max garnered nearly instant praise following its release in 1985, taking home Bike of the Year honors for its custom cruiser looks and lightning fast acceleration. Cornering has always been a bit of an achilles heel for the V-Max.</p>
